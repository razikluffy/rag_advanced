# Introduction to Fraud Analysis

## What is a Fraud Analyst?
A Fraud Analyst is a specialized professional responsible for detecting, investigating, and preventing fraudulent activities within an organization. They analyze financial transactions, customer accounts, and internal operations to identify suspicious patterns that may indicate criminal behavior.

## Key Responsibilities
1. **Transaction Monitoring**: Reviewing real-time transaction data to flag anomalies.
2. **Investigation**: Conducting deep-dive investigations into flagged accounts or activities.
3. **Pattern Recognition**: Identifying trends and new typologies of fraud (e.g., synthetic identity theft).
4. **Reporting**: Documenting findings and escalating confirmed fraud cases to law enforcement or internal legal teams.
5. **Rule Optimization**: Tuning fraud detection rules to minimize false positives while maximizing detection rates.

## Types of Fraud
- **Account Takeover (ATO)**: Unauthorized access to a user's account.
- **Card Testing**: Small transactions used to verify if stolen card details are valid.
- **Synthetic Identity Fraud**: Creating a fake identity using a combination of real and fabricated information.
- **Friendly Fraud**: A consumer makes a purchase and then disputes the charge with their bank.

## Tools & Technologies
Fraud Analysts use a variety of tools, including:
- **SQL & Python**: For querying databases and analyzing large datasets.
- **Device Fingerprinting**: Identifying returning devices to detect patterns.
- **Biometric Verification**: Using facial recognition or behavioral biometrics.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Automated scoring of transaction risk.

## Career Path
Most Fraud Analysts start in entry-level roles requiring a bachelor's degree in finance, criminal justice, or data analysis. With experience, they can advance to:
- Senior Fraud Analyst
- Fraud Strategy Manager
- Director of Trust & Safety
